Overview
A sapphic YA graphic novel with sword fighting, political intrigue and magic where the princess needs a marriage alliance for the welfare of her kingdom, but she unknowingly accepts a proposal from a mysterious country, having come not from the prince, but his sister.
 
 The Marble Queen is a YA fantasy graphic novel thatâ€™s the political drama of Nimona meets the heartfelt romance of The Princess and the Dressmaker, but this time in a sapphic romance surrounded by a mist of magic.
 
 Princess Ameliaâ€™s kingdom, Marion, is in shambles after months of their trade routes being ravaged by pirates. Now, it seems the only option left for her is to save it through a marriage alliance. When she gets an exorbitant offer from the royalty of Iliadâ€”a country shrouded in mysteryâ€”Amelia accepts without question and leaves her home to begin a new life.
 
 But she lands on Iliadâ€™s shores to find that her betrothed isn&#039;t the countryâ€™s prince, but the recently coronated Queen Salira.
 
 Shocked, Amelia tries to make sense of her situation and her confused heart: Salira has awakened strange new feelings inside her, but something dark hides behind the queen&#039;s sorrowful eyes. Amelia must fight the demons of her own anxiety disorder before she can tackle her wife&#039;s, all while war looms on the horizon.
