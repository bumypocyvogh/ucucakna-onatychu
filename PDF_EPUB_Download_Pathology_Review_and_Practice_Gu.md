Overview
Prepare for licensing exams offered by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and the American Board of Pathology with the most comprehensive review guide available. Pathology Review and Practice Guide updates the first edition, Pathology Review, and now contains more than 1400 color photographs and 3100 short answer and multiple choice questions. It&#039;s the only guide that features question formats found on Canadian exams. The new edition also meets the demand for competency-based education with the inclusion of protocols from the College of American Pathologists for examining and reporting tumors. Pathology Review and Practice Guide is now more than an exam preparation toolâ€”it&#039;s also a guide to the training of competent pathologists. This updated edition also includes a new chapter on quality assurance and laboratory management. The 19 topics covered in this guide include basic science, cardiovascular pathology, forensic pathology, infectious diseases, neurological and muscular pathology, and more. Questions are framed to rehearse case scenarios, differential diagnoses, diagnostic procedures, classification of tumors, hallmark features of pathological entities, and pathogenesis. You will also find tips for maximizing your success both on the exam and in your practice.
