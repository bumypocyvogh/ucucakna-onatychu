Will good prevail over evil once and for all? The thrilling, heartfelt finale to the New York Times bestselling Hooky series, based on the beloved WEBTOON comic. Reeling from three years of anti-magic rule under the kingâ€”and three years disconnected from twin witches Dani and Dorianâ€”Princess Monica, Nico, Damien, and Prince William know that it is now their responsibility to save the kingdom, and their friends, before darkness prevails. Determined to uncover the circumstances of Dorianâ€™s disappearance and rescue reigning Queen of the Witches Dani from her mysterious curse, the group comes together for one final, epic adventure. On a mission that takes them across the kingdom, friendships are tested, romances bloom, and the past holds the key to their future. Dorian, Dani, and all the witches and non-magical people of the kingdom must decide once and for all: Who will they be, and will they use their power and influence for good?
