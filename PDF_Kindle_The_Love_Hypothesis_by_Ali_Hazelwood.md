A BuzzFeed Best Summer Read of 2021

 When a fake relationship between scientists meets the irresistible force of attraction, it throws one woman&amp;#039;s carefully calculated theories on love into chaos.

 As a third-year Ph.D. candidate, Olive Smith doesn&amp;#039;t believe in lasting romantic relationships‚Äîbut her best friend does, and that&amp;#039;s what got her into this situation. Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way to a happily ever after was always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. So, like any self-respecting biologist, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees.

 That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor‚Äîand well-known ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when Stanford&amp;#039;s reigning lab tyrant agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science conference goes haywire, putting Olive&amp;#039;s career on the Bunsen burner, Adam surprises her again with his unyielding support and even more unyielding...six-pack abs.

 Suddenly their little experiment feels dangerously close to combustion. And Olive discovers that the only thing more complicated than a hypothesis on love is putting her own heart under the microscope.
