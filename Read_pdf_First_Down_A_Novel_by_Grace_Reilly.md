Overview
Welcome to McKee University in this spicy adult sports romance, first in the BookTok sensation Beyond the Play seriesâ€”with new exclusive content in this edition. Tutoring the star quarterback in exchange for a few fake dates wonâ€™t lead to anything moreâ€¦ right? James Football is my everything. I live, eat, breathe the sport. But when I transfer to McKee University to escape the distractions that nearly cost me my future in the NFL, Iâ€™m faced with another consequence: retake and pass the writing class I failed at my last college or lose any chance I have at making it big. Thatâ€™s where fellow senior Beckett Woodâ€”gorgeous, stubborn, and just my typeâ€”comes in. Sheâ€™s the key to my success in this classâ€¦ but the price of her help is a fake relationship, and I never do things halfway. Bex I donâ€™t mess around with athletesâ€”Iâ€™ve already learned that lessonâ€”and at first glance, handsome, self-assured James Callahan is no exception. He wants me to help him pass the writing class weâ€™re both stuck taking, but Iâ€™m too busy to take on yet another responsibility. But when his teammateâ€”my cheating exâ€”wonâ€™t leave me alone, I realize I need to convince him Iâ€™ve moved onâ€¦ and what better way than by pretending to be with James, who wants nothing to do with a real relationship? Yet with every fake kiss, James pulls me deeper into a place that thrills and terrifies me. Why does he make me feel alive like no one else has? And why donâ€™t I want it to end? Filled with swoons, spice, sports, and the ultimate book boyfriend,Â First DownÂ is a donâ€™t-miss adult college sports romance!
